**Driving Problem:**

**Work for the checkpoint:** <br>
The group agreed that the general work for this checkpoint is mostly individual, with the personal coding for three different individuals in the study. For my jupyter notebook I looked at the participants who had the Ids: 1503960366, 1624580081 and 1844505072. I analysed the average step counts for all three individuals, while also looking at the mean, median, max and min step counts for all three unique Ids. This would provide a general background of the data and provide an understanding of the data for Assignment 2. <br>

Additionally, before data exploratory analysis occurs, background research of the (Tang et al., 2018) paper was conducted, where it was assumed that any days or step counts that fell under a certian threshold (i.e less than 0) would be removed, to make the data adhere to the set criteria of assignment 2. <br>

However, the group will discuss and agree the driving problem, and what data sets can be used to answer the driving problem. Additionally, the group will aim to set a timeline, a group GitHub and wiki link for "assignment 2"

**A link to notebook(s) you committed to Github with your code for data exploration.** <br>
This notebook includes a data exploratory analysis and literate programming for three invididual Ids: 1503960366, 1624580081 and 1844505072 for the fitness tracker dataset <br>

Make sure the link is to the commit made before the deadline. (You can link to a Github file at a specific commit by: (1) click on the file, (2) click on the "History" button/ link, (3) copy the URL of the title for the commit you want.)
Please add a brief description of the notebook.

**A table that summarises your allocated work** <br>
**_Table 1_** _Table showing the allocated work for this project, with a description, status and comments on the work_ <br>

| Description    | Status   | Comment(s)   |
| :---:          | :---:    | :---:        |
| Personal Coding note book on the three different individuals| Complete |  Data exploratory analysis on the 3 different datasets       |
| Background research on supplied papers                      | Complete |  Gave an idea on how to deal with threshold values and adherence |                

**Statement about all help you received in:** <br>
manually scrutinising the data
writing the code
debugging code
interpreting the data
(include all help from team members, other people, online resources, GAI) <br>

As said above, the (Tang et al., 2018) paper was read and analysed to conduct different data analysis and improve adherence of the data. Alongide this paper, scrutinising the data was supplied by the DATA3406 unit coordinator and tutors, as they provided the datasets to use in the assignment. For the driving problem: ....... it was can be scrutinised that the .... dataset(s) are the best to use. 
Additionally, the slides from week 6,7 and 8 were all used to in the data exploratory individual checkpoint notebook. <br>

### References used in Checkpoint 1 

**_References for online resources that were used to clean the data_** <br>
In order to complete the personal coding jupyter notebook for the Individual Checkpoint one a range of different online resources were used to help debunk the code, and understand any errors that may have occured. <br>

If an issue occured, StackOverFlow was used to help understand the error, alongside the website GeeksforGeeks, to help improve the code. Excel was also used to gain a full oversight of the data, and to just gain a general understanding of the overall structure of the data before any data analysis was used.

**_Following Websites were used:_** <br>
https://sparkbyexamples.com/numpy/numpy-count-nonzero-values-in python/#:~:text=NumPy%20count_nonzero()%20function%20in,arr%20%2C%20axis%20%2C%20and%20keepdims%20. <br>


Additionally, to make the README.md file easier to understand, github help websites were used to find functions to help make the file more appealing (such as making text bold, or creating a table) <br>

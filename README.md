# Data3406-Assignment 2 - Individual Checkpoint 1 
 - Group Id: CC04, Group 1 - 

** Driving Problem: **

** Work for the checkpoint: **
The general work for this checkpoint is mostly individual, with the personal coding for three different individuals in the study. For my jupyter notebook I looked at the participants who had the Ids: 1503960366, 1624580081 and 1844505072. I analysed the average step counts for all three individuals, while also looking at the mean, median, max and min step counts for all three unique Ids.
